VectorNet Protocol Specification v2

2/16/09: The first specification of the VectorNet protocol was written. This was a text based protocol which used values separated by null strings.

12/30/09: The Second revision of the protocol is made. This usitilizes multiple data types for information. In this version, the packets for VectorNet are made of of these parts:

	BYTE    Packet ID
	WORD   Packet Length
	VOID    Data

Note: By default, the port for VectorNet is 4800.

When flag is mentioned in any of these packets, it refers to these values:
	0x00: Normal VectorNet User
	0x01: VectorNet Admin
	0x02: VectorNet Moderator
	0x04: VectorNet Channel Operator
	0x08: squelched
	0x10: muted
	0x20: hidden (unseen by the client, cannot parse info, but can hear text)

If you see Client <-> Server, that means the data sent is exactly the same data
that is received from client to server, and vice versa

Changes:

 - VNET_LOGON S>C 0x02
   - STRING Username (To show unique name, if logged on more than once)
   - Result byte 0x04: Account passed, You need to send a challenge to complete logon
   - Removed BYTE for protocol ID
 - VNET_CHATEVENT S>C 0x02
   - Added byte 0x04 to ID_SERVERINFO: Broadcast message

10/18/2010

 - Fixed a few things, and added some more data
 - VNET_APPS -> APP_TICTACTOE (0x01)

You must send the queue sharing packet with ID 0x01 to enable queue sharing.
You must also be in the same Battle.Net channel as another user who is also
participating in queue sharing. Furthermore, they must be in the same IP pool
as you are. If you are the channel master, you may open and close the pool
at your leisure. If the pool is closed, no one else may join your queue pool
